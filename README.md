# Clouds-Tracking-Using-Satellite-Data

Cloud tracking system is machine learning model presented in the form of web application. The system predicts the trajectory of the clouds in the environment based on the daily data received from the satellites. By tracking the trajectories of the cloud in the surrounding, meterological department can generate insights of the cloud near a particular area and predict the possibility of rain the area.

This project consists of a machine learning model which uses TOBAC library to predict the tracjectory of the clouds. 
A User Friendly UI is created for user to interact with the model using streamlit library.
